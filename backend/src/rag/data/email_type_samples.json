      "text": "Traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip. Especially if you have to prepare a presentation. I would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings. I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary.\n\nAs far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not. Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn. The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format. \n\nMy suggestion for where to go is Austin. Play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski's. Flying somewhere takes too much time.",

Now or for the land closing? Investment \nschedule?\n\n Investment Return\n\n Is Equity Repayment the return of the original investment?\n\n Is the plan to wait until the last unit is sold and closed before profits \nare distributed?\n\n Debt\n\n Which entity is the borrower for each loan and what recourse or collateral \nis associated with each \n loan?\n\n Improvement\n\n Construction\n\n Are these the only two loans?

Internet viewing \nfor investors?\n\n Reports to track expenses vs plan?\n\n Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses?\n\n What is the relationship of Creekside Builders to the project? Do you get \npaid a markup on subcontractors as a \n general contractor and paid gain out of profits?\n\n Do you or Larry receive any money in the form of salary or personal expenses \nbefore the ultimate payout of profits?\n\n Design and Construction\n \n When will design be complete?\n\n What input will investors have in selecting design and materials for units?\n\n What level of investor involvement will be possible during construction \nplanning and permitting?\n\n Does Creekside have specific procedures for dealing with subcontractors, \nvendors, and other professionals? \n Such as always getting 3 bids, payment schedules, or reference checking?\n\n Are there any specific companies or individuals that you already plan to \nuse?

I tried to get a real estate atty on the phone last \nnight but he was out of pocket.? I talked to a crim. atty friend and he said \nthis is out of his area but doesn't sound binding to him.? \n?\nI will go back to mine and Phillip Allen's transaction?and take a look at \nthat but as vague and general as this is I doubt that my signature? is even \nneeded to complete this transaction.? I am in after 12 noon if there is any \nneed to contact me regarding the closing.\n?\nI really do not want to hold up anything or generate more work for myself \nand I don't want to insult or annoy anyone but this paper really doesn't \nseem to be something required for a closing.?

Remember that I do not know the Northwest at all, so this may not be \nan issue, but I'll point it out and let you decide. Let me know if this is \nO.K. as is, so I'll know to ignore it in the future. Also, if you want me to \nget with Kim and the Sitara people to change the mapping, let me know and \nI'll take care of it..\n\nOn PG&E NW, it appears that PGEN Kingsgate is mapped to a Malin Citygate \ncurve instead of a Kingsgate curve, resulting in a total transport loss of \n$235,019. \n(If the mapping were changed, it should just reallocate p&l--not change your \noverall p&l.) Maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affects \nsomething else somewhere that I am not seeing, but anyway, here are the Deal \n#'s, paths and p&l impacts of each.\n 139195 From Kingsgate to Malin ($182,030)\n 139196 From Kingsgate to PGEN/Tuscarora ($ 4,024)\n 139197 From Kingsgate to PGEN Malin ($ 8,271)\n 231321 From Kingsgate to Malin ($ 38,705)\n 153771 From Kingsgate to Stanfield ($ 1,988)\n Suggested fix: Change PGEN Kingsgate mapping from GDP-Malin Citygate to \nGDP-Kingsgate.\n\n Clay Basin storage--this is really a FYI more than anything else--I see five \ndifferent tickets in Sitara for Clay Basin activity--one appears to be for \nwithdrawals and the other four are injections. Clay Basin is valued as a \nQuestar curve, which is substantially below NWPL points. What this means is \nthat any time you are injecting gas, these tickets will show transport \nlosses; each time you are withdrawing, you will show big gains on transport. \nI'm not sure of the best way to handle this since we don't really have a \nsystematic Sitara way of handling storage deals. In an ideal world, it seems \nthat you would map it the way you have it today, but during injection times, \nthe transport cost would pass through as storage costs. Anyway, here's the \ndetail on the tickets just for your info, plus I noticed three days where it \nappears we were both withdrawing and injecting from Clay Basin. There may be \nan operational reason why this occurred that I'm not aware of, and the dollar \nimpact is very small, but I thought I'd bring it to your attention just in \ncase there's something you want to do about it. The columns below show the \nvolumes under each ticket and the p&L associated with each. \n \nDeal # 251327 159540 265229 \n106300 201756\nP&L $29,503 ($15,960) ($3,199) \n($2,769) ($273)\nRec: Ques/Clay Basin/0184 NWPL/Opal 543 NWPL/Opal Sumas NWPL/S of \nGr Rvr\nDel: NWPL/S of Green River/Clay Ques/Clay Basin/0852 Ques/Clay \nBasin/0852 Ques/Clay Basin Ques/Clay Basin\n1 329 8,738\n2 1,500\n3 2,974 11,362\n4 6,741 12,349 1,439\n5 19,052 3,183\n9 333\n13 30,863 2,680\n14 30,451 \n15 35,226 \n16 6,979 235 \n17 17,464 \n18 9,294 \n20 10,796 771\n21 17,930 \n22 10,667 \n23 14,415 9,076\n25 23,934 8,695\n26 3,284 \n27 1,976\n28 1,751 \n29 1,591 \n30 20,242",

Your intuition as to reductions seen so far (e.g., March 2001 vs. \nMarch 2000) was absolutely correct. At this point, it appears that demand \nover the last 12 months in the CAISO control area, after adjusting for \ntemperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%. This translates \ninto a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 MWa for last month (March 2001) as \ncompared with the previous year.\n\nLooking forward into the summer, I believe that we will see further voluntary \nreductions (as opposed to \"forced\" reductions via rolling blackouts). Other \nforecasters (e.g., PIRA) are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 MWa (making \ntotal year-on-year reduction = 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in June. \nThis scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couple \nmore percentage points reduction in overall peak demand. Given that the 6% \ndecrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the \nretail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, I think that it \nis possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to last \nyear. This would mean peak demand reductions of approx 3,300-3,500 MWa in \nJun-Aug. In addition, a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservation \nare being promoted by the State, which can only increase the likelihood of \nmeeting, and perhaps exceeding, the 3,500 MWa figure. Finally, the general \neconomic slowdown in Calif could also further depress demand, or at least \nmake the 3,500 MWa number that much more attainable.\n\nNote that all the numbers I am reporting here are for the CAISO control area \nonly, which represents about 89% of total Calif load, or 36-37% of WSCC \n(U.S.) summer load. I think it is reasonable to assume that the non-ISO \nportion of Calif (i.e., LADWP and IID) will see similar reductions in \ndemand. As for the rest of the WSCC, that is a much more difficult call. As \nyou are aware, the Pacific NW has already seen about 2,000 MWa of aluminum \nsmelter load come off since Dec, and this load is expected to stay off at \nleast through Sep, and possibly for the next couple of years (if BPA gets its \nwish). This figure represents approx 4% of the non-Calif WSCC. Several \nmining operations in the SW and Rockies have recently announced that they are \nsharply curtailing production. I have not yet been able to pin down exactly \nhow many MW this translates to, but I will continue to research the issue. \nOther large industrials may follow suit, and the ripple effects from Calif's \neconomic slowdown could be a factor throughout the West. While the rest of \nthe WSCC may not see the 10%+ reductions that I am expecting in Calif, I \nthink we could easily expect an additional 2-3% (on top of the 4% already \nrealized), or approx 1,000-1,500 MWa, of further demand reduction in the \nnon-Calif WSCC for this summer. This would bring the total reduction for the \nWSCC, including the 2,000 MWa aluminum load we have already seen, to around \n6,500-7,000 MWa when compared with last summer.\n\nI am continuing to research and monitor the situation, and will provide you \nwith updates as new or better information becomes available. Meantime, I \nhope this helps. Please feel free to call (503-464-8671) if you have any \nquestions or need any further information.",

Negotiations with SCE on this proposal are essentially \ncomplete. PG&E is OK with the docs. All QFs but Calpine have agreed with \nthe IEP proposal -- Under the proposal, PG&E would \"retain\" $106 million (of \nwhat, I'm not sure -- I think they mean a refund to PG&E from QFs who \nswitched to PX pricing). The money would come from changing the basis for the \nQF payments from the PX price to the SRAC price, starting back in December \n(and maybe earlier).\n\nPG&E will not commit to a payment schedule and will not commit to take the \nForce Majeure notices off the table. QFs are asking IEP to attempt to get \nsome assurances of payment. \n\nSCE has defaulted with its QFs; PG&E has not yet -- but big payments are due \non 2/2/01.\n\nFor gas-fired QFs -- Heat rate of 10.2 included in formula for PG&E's \npurchases from such QFs. Two people are negotiating the these agreements \n(Elcantar and Bloom), but they are going very slowly. Not clear this can be \nresolved. Batten and Keeley are refereeing this. No discussions on this \noccurred today.\n\nStatus of legislation -- Keeley left town for the night, so not much will \nhappen on the QFs.Assembly and Senate realize they have to work together. \nPlan to meld together AB 1 with Hertzberg's new bill .

As you can tell from the proforma this project\nshould produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.\nThis is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as\nAustin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for\nthis market. This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we\nhave uncovered to date in the Austin market.\nThe project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan. As\nit is in the \"Smart Growth Corridor\" area designated by the City of Austin\nfor preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete\nin less than 6 months. Additionally, many of the current and more severe\nwater treatment ordinances have been waived. I have estimated the lot\nimprovement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North\nAustin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street\nwidening. Even though this property is not likely to require street\nwidening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond\nrequirement, I used this data to be cautious.\n The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not\nexpected to impact sales significantly. Other projects have been quite\nsuccessful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the\nadjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.\nAs with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods\nis uneven. We have included a fence around the entire property, but may\nonly put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop. Gated communities are far\npreferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer\npreferences.\nThe seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and\nan extended escrow. This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site\nplan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into\nan A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.\nThis analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the\nprofits of the project. As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss\nhaving you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity\nwith your profit in the lot. I believe this would facilitate the use of a\n1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a\nrental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then\nbe the equity for that project. You would need to discuss this with an\nexchange expert first. Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San\nAntonio if you do not know anyone.\nI will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,\nby Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.\nOnce you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to\nschedule a tour of the site and the area. Please get back to me as soon as\nyour schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any\ntime. You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either\n512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110. My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is\n512-338-1103. I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you\non this project that is sure to be a major winner.\nI regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual\nevents these past few weeks. A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg\ndowndrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.\nOne of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to\nstart the next day. The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough\nto knock it down. The City shut down the project for a week and it took\nanother week to get every thing back on tract. Then last week I had to take\nmy wife to emergency. She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra\nin her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this\npast week.. There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize\nthe enormous number of things she does everyday. Fortunately, it looks as\nif she will be ok in the long run.\nGeorge W.

This would produce an average sq\nfootage of 1233, which would be $73.80 psf at $182,000. (I thought his\nsales price was $187,000.) At this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sell\nfor $203,108.\nWhat is more important, in my view, is a) the rental rate and b) the\nrent-ability. You have all of our current rental and cost data for your own\nevaluation. As for rent-ability, I believe that we have shown that the\n3-bedroom, 3.5 bath is strongly preferred in this market. In fact, if we\nwere able to purchase additional lots from Regan we would build 4 bedroom\nunits along with the 3-bedroom plan.\nPhillip, I will call you today to go over this more thoroughly.\nSincerely,\nGeorge W.

This will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from their \ncommissions as to what an acceptable portfolio (fixed, indexed, collars....) \nshould look like. Offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of month \nindex may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk. That \nrisk may not be acceptable to the desk. I will do some investigation of \ntheir PGA's and see if there is an opportunity.\n\nAs to the asset management: do you have any preference on structure? Are \nthere elements that you would like to see? Any ideas at all would be greatly \nappreciated.\n\nThanks,\n\nLaird",

I have received estimates structured as follows:\n\n 5% - onsite expenses, supervision, clean up, equipment\n 2%- overhead\n 4%- profit\n\nI just wanted to give you this initial feedback. I have also attached an \nextremely primitive spreadsheet to outline the project. As you can see even \nreducing the builders fees to the numbers above the project would only \ngenerate $219,194 of cash flow for a return of 21%. I am not thrilled about \nsuch a low return. I think I need to find a way to get the total cost down \nto $10,500,000 which would boost the return to 31%. Any ideas?\n\nI realize that you are offering significant development experience plus you \nlocal connections. I am not discounting those services.

Technically, that bank lowered the \nloan amount based on lower estimates of rents which altered the amount of \nequity that would be required. \n\nDid I loan them $1,300,000? I thought it was less.\n\nRegarding Exhibit A, the assets include: the land, architectural plans, \nengineering completed, appraisal, and soils study.

According to BPA,\nit had excess energy to sell as a result of running water to meet\nbiological opinion flow standards, but it has stopped doing so in\norder to allow reservoirs to fill from runoff. The agency said it had\nbeen telling California's Department of Water Resources that the\nsales could cease at any time, and this morning they ended.\n\nCal-ISO reported about 1,600 MW less imports today than\nyesterday, so it appears other sellers have also cut back.\nYesterday, PowerEx said it was not selling into California because\nof concerns about its water reserves.

Attached is a spreadsheet that outlines the $ magnitude of the next \nfew months.\n\nTALKING POINTS:\n\nLot's of questions about DWR becoming the vehicle for S-T buying and there \nis a significant legal risk for it becoming the vehicle. WE DO NEED \nSOMETHING TO BRIDGE BEFORE WE PUT IN L-T CONTRACTS.\nHuge and growing shortfall ($3.2B through March 31, 2001) \nThe SOONER YOU CAN PUT IN L-T CONTRACTS STOP THE BLEEDING.\nBankruptcy takes all authority out of the Legislature's hands.\n\nACTION ITEMS:\n\n1. Energy Sales Participation Agreement During Bankruptcy\n\nMichael Tribolet will be contacting John Klauberg to discuss how to organize \na Participation Agreement to sell to UDCs in Bankruptcy while securing Super \nPriority.\n\n2. Legislative Language for CDWR (?) Buying Short-Term\n\nSandi McCubbin / Jeff Dasovich will lead team to offer new language to meet \nS-T requirements of UDCs. Key is to talk with State of California Treasurer \nto see if the $ can be found or provided to private firms. ($3.5B by end of \nApril). Pat Boylston will develop \"public benefit\" language for options \nworking with Mike Day. He can be reached at 503-294-9116 or \npgboylston@stoel.com.\n\n3. Get Team to Sacramento\n\nGet with Hertzberg to discuss the options (Bev Hansen). Explain the \nmagnitude of the problem. Get Mike Day to help draft language. \n\n4. See if UDCs have any Thoughts\n\nSteve Kean will communicate with UDCs to see if they have any solutions or \nthougths. Probably of limited value.\n\n5. Update List\n\nAny new information on this should be communicated to the following people as \nsoon as possible. These people should update their respective business units.\n\nENA Legal - Christian Yoder / Travis McCullough\nCredit - Michael Tribolet\nEES - Vicki Sharp / Don Black\nENA - Tim Belden / Philip Allen\nGovt Affairs - Steve Kean / Richard Shapiro",

Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that the final order will contain a fixed price cap. I base this belief in large part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert. Although the Chairman began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had some enlightening comments which relate to price caps:\n\nPrice caps are almost never the right answer\nPrice Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages\nCompetitive choices for consumers is the right answer\nAny solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce demand, is not acceptable\nEight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would export California's problems to the West\n\nThis is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it's a pretty strong anti- price cap position. Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the agenda. Hope this info helps.

They were polite regarding \nasset management and procurement function outsourcing and are willing to \nlisten to a proposal. However, they are very interested in weather hedges to \nprotect throughput related earnings. We are pursuing a confidentiality \nagreement with them to facilitate the sharing of information that will enable \nus to develop proposals. Our pitch was based upon enhancing shareholder \nvalue by outsourcing a non-profit and costly function (procurement) and by \nreducing the volatility of their earnings by managing throughput via a \nweather product.\n\nAs to your other question. We have yet to identify or pursue other \ncandidates; however, Mike McDonald and I are developing a coverage strategy \nto ensure that we meet with all potential entities and investigate our \nopportunities. We met with 8 entities this week (7 Municipals and SWG) as we \nimplement our strategy in California.\n\nAre there any entities that you think would be interested in an asset \nmanagement deal that we should approach? Otherwise, we intend to \nsystematically identify and work through all the candidates. \n\nLaird",

Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that \nthe final order will contain a fixed price cap. I base this belief in large \npart on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which \nthe keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert. Although the Chairman \nbegan his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or \nanswer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had \nsome enlightening comments which relate to price caps:\n\nPrice caps are almost never the right answer\nPrice Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages\nCompetitive choices for consumers is the right answer\nAny solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce \ndemand, is not acceptable\nEight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would \nexport California's problems to the West\n\nThis is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it's a pretty \nstrong anti- price cap position. Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner \nout of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and \nif the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the \nagenda.

      "text": "Jeff,\n\nBefore you write off the stage, a few things to think about.\n\n1. Operating expenses include $22,000 of materials for maintenance and \nrepairs. Plus having a full time onsite maintenance man means no extra labor \ncost for repairs. There are only 44 units a lot of his time is spent on \nrepairs.\n\n2. What is an outside management firm going to do? A full time onsite \nmanager is all that is required. As I mentioned the prior manager has \ninterest in returning. Another alternative would be to hire a male manager \nthat could do more make readies and lawn care. If you turn it over to a \nmanagement company you could surely reduce the cost of a full time manager \nonsite.\n\n3. Considering #1 & #2 $115,000 NOI is not necessarily overstated. If you \nwant to be ultra conservative use $100,000 at the lowest.\n\n4. Getting cash out is not a priority to me. So I am willing to structure \nthis deal with minimum cash. A 10% note actually attractive. See below.\n\nMy job just doesn't give me the time to manage this property. This property \ndefinitely requires some time but it has the return to justify the effort.\n\nSales Price 705,000\n\n1st Lien 473,500\n\n2nd Lien 225,000\n\nTransfer fee 7,500\n\nCash required 14,500\n\nNOI 100,000\n\n1st Lien 47,292\n\n2nd Lien 23,694\n\nCash flow 29,014\n\nCash on cash 200%\n\nThese numbers are using the conservative NOI, if it comes in at $115K then \ncash on cash return would be more like 300%. This doesn't reflect the \nadditional profit opportunity of selling the property in the next few years \nfor a higher price.\n\nDo you want to reconsider? Let me know.\n\nPhillip",

I am asking that you forward \nthis note to any potential interviewers (Managers or above). We will conduct \nfirst round interviews in the morning and the second round interviews in the \nafternoon. We need for interviewers to commit either to the morning \n(9am-12pm) or afternoon (2pm-5pm) complete session. Please submit your \nresponse using the buttons below and update your calendar for this date. In \naddition, we will need the groups that have current needs to commit to taking \none or more of these Analysts should they be extended an offer. Thanks in \nadvance for your cooperation.\n\n \n\nThank you,\nJana",

If \nyou need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626.\n\nAs far as recommendations, here is a short list:\n\n 1. Examine LDC's incentive rate program. Current methodology rewards sales \nabove monthly index without enough consideration of future \n replacement cost. The result is that the LDC's sell gas that should be \ninjected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index.\n This creates a shortage in later months.\n\n 2. California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet \ndemand. Investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally. \n Specific questions should include: \n\n 1. Why in March '00-May '00 weren't total system receipts higher in order \nto fill storage?\n\n 2. Why are there so many examples of OFO's on weekends that push away too \nmuch gas from Socal's system. \n I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their \nown demand. They repeatedly estimated they would receive more gas than \ntheir injection capablity, but injected far less.\n\n 3. Similar to the power market, there is too much benchmarking to short \nterm prices. Not enough forward hedging is done by the major \n LDCs. By design the customers are short at a floating \nrate. This market has been long historically. It has been a buyers market \nand the \n consumer has benefitted. \n\nCall me if you need any more input.\n\nPhillip",
